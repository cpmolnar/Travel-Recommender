# TravelRecommender
Brief demonstration of modern Object-Oriented Programming concepts. 

The project allows users to search for travel destinations from a database using five pre-defined parameters: Name, Popularity, User Rating, Country, and Continent. The Search Similarity algorithm uses a Levenshtein distance algorithm to compute String similarity, and a simple Sigmoid regression algorithm to compute Integer and Decimal similarity.

I've covered the following Object-Oriented Concepts in this demonstration:
- Abstraction
- Generic typing
- Interfaces
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
